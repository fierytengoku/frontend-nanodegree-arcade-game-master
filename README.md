Everytime you make it to the water you'll recieve 10 points and will have your player reset against faster bugs! Get hit by a bug and have your score, player, and enemy speed reset to try again. Challenge yourself by seeing how high of a score you can get! Game Creator's Best Score: 120. Good luck!
